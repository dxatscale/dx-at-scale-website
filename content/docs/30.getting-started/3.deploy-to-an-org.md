title: Deploy to a Salesforce Org
sub-title: Before diving into DX@Scale, you need to be comfortable with the Salesforce CLI. You will go through the process of deploying the content of a git repository to a Salesforce org using the Metadata API and the Salesforce CLI.
---

## Learning Objectives

* Get comfortable with CLI tools
* Deploy a repo using Metadata API (MDAPI) to a Salesforce org
* Change the configuration in a Salesforce org
* Retrieve these changes from the org
* Identify what has changed
* Update your local and remote repositories with the changes from the org
* Deploy these changes to another org

::hint
If you are already familiar with the Salesforce CLI, you can skip this section and move on to the next.
::

**Time to complete**: 45 minutes.

## Create new Salesforce Playground Orgs
For this tutorial, you will need two Salesforce Orgs. One will be used to deploy the code from the repository, apply and retrieve a few changes, and the other will be used for the deployment of these changes.

1. If you don't already have one, create an account on [Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/)
2. Click on your profile icon in the top right corner and select **Hands-On Orgs**
3. Create two playgrounds:
  - Click on **Create Playground** and give your org a descriptive name, for example, *"DX@Scale MDAPI Source"*. Click on **Create**.
  - Click on **Create Playground** and give your org a descriptive name, for example, *"DX@Scale MDAPI Target"*. Click on **Create**.

::hint
It may take several minutes for the playgrounds to be created.
::

## Authenticate to your orgs using the Salesforce CLI

Your orgs are now created, but you need to authenticate to them using the Salesforce CLI.

### Authenticate to your source org
1. On Hands-On Orgs page, click on the **Launch** button to open your org in a new browser tab
2. Once your org is open, click on the **Get Your Login Credentials** tab
3. Note the **Username** for the playground, you will need it later to authenticate to the org using the Salesforce CLI
4. Click on the **Reset My Password** button, this will send a reset password email to the email address associated with your Trailhead account
5. Confirm that you want your password to be reset by clicking on the **OK** button
6. Open the email you received from Salesforce and click on the link to reset your password
7. Click on the **Reset Password** button
8. Change the password to something you can remember and click the **Change Password** button
9. Confirm that you can login to your org using the new password by first logging out of your org and then logging back in
10. If you wish you can register a mobile phone number on the next page
11. Authenticate your SFDX CLI in the terminal to one the source org
```shell[Terminal]
$ sfdx force:auth:web:login -a MdapiSource
```
12. Click **Allow** to authorize the CLI to access your org
13. Check that the org is authenticated by running the following command in your terminal
```shell [Terminal]
$ sfdx org:list
```
```
Non-scratch orgs
====================================================================================
|     ALIAS       USERNAME                       ORG ID             CONNECTED STATUS
| ─── ─────────── ────────────────────────────── ────────────────── ────────────────
|     MdapiSource ramzi@curious-koala-5fte3s.com 00D2w00000RHecZABB Connected
No active scratch orgs found. Specify --all to see all scratch orgs.
```

::hint
We are using a convention where sandboxes are identified using Pascal Case, ie. `MdapiSource` and scratch orgs are identified using camel case, ie. `mdapiSource`
::

### Authenticate to your target org

Repeat the operations above to authenticate to your target org.

Don't forget to change the alias of the org to `MdapiTarget` when you run the `sfdx auth:web:login` command.

```shell[Terminal]
$ sfdx force:auth:web:login -a MdapiTarget
```

### Final check

Run the following command to check that you have authenticated to both orgs

```shell[Terminal]
$ sfdx org:list
```

You should see something like this:

```
Non-scratch orgs
====================================================================================
|     ALIAS       USERNAME                       ORG ID             CONNECTED STATUS
| ─── ─────────── ────────────────────────────── ────────────────── ────────────────
|     MdapiSource ramzi@curious-koala-5fte3s.com 00D2w00000RHecZEAT Connected
|     MdapiTarget ramzi@brave-narwhal-112qm9.com 00D2w00000RHecgEAD Connected
No active scratch orgs found. Specify --all to see all scratch orgs.
```

Congratulations, you have authenticated to your orgs using the Salesforce CLI!

## Deploy the Dreamhouse app to the source org

### Clone the repository
1. Fork the [DX@Scale 101 repo](https://github.com/dxatscale/dxatscale101) to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repo from your GitHub account to a local repo:

```shell[Terminal]
$ git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/dxatscale101.git dxatscale101-mdapi
```

3. Open up the project in **VS Code**

```shell[Terminal]
$ cd dxatscale101-mdapi
$ code .
```

### Deploy the repo to the source org

Use the `force:mdapi:deploy` command to deploy the repo to the source org. This command will deploy the code from the `mdapi` folder to the `MdapiSource` org and wait for a maximum of 30 minutes.

```shell[Terminal]
$ sfdx force:mdapi:deploy -u MdapiSource -d mdapi -w 30
```

If the deployment is successful, you should see something like this:

```
Deploying metadata to ramzi@curious-koala-5fte3s.com using the v57.0 SOAP API
Deploy ID: 0Af2w00000pgzABCAY
DEPLOY PROGRESS | ████████████████████████████████████████ | 86/86 Components
```

![Dreamhouse initial deployment](/docs/tutorial/dreamhouse-deploy.webp)

### Populate the app with data using the Salesforce CLI

The Dreamhouse app comes with a set of sample data that you can use to populate your org with data. You can use the Salesforce CLI to populate your org with data.

But first, you need to be able to see the application. To do this, you are going to assign a permission set to your user.

```shell[Terminal]
$ sfdx force:user:permset:assign -u MdapiSource -n dreamhouse
```

You should see something like this after a while:

```
=== Permsets Assigned

 Username                       Permission Set Assignment
 ────────────────────────────── ─────────────────────────
 ramzi@curious-koala-5fte3s.com dreamhouse
```

Now we are going to use the Salesforce CLI to populate the org with data.

```shell[Terminal]
$ sfdx data tree import --target-org MdapiSource -p ./data/sample-data-plan.json
```

This command takes a **plan** and seeds the org with data. The plan is a JSON file that describes the data to be imported. The plan is located in the `data` folder of the repo.

After a few seconds, you should see the following output:

```
=== Import Results

10. Click **Next**
11. On the Step 3 page, click **Next**
12. On the Step 4 page, click **Save**, this will add the field to the **Property** object's layout

#### Create a new Apex class

1. Click on the **gear icon** at the top of the page and select the **Developer Console** option
2. In the developer console, click on the **File** menu and select the **New --> Apex Class** option
3. Enter "ContactController" as the **Name** and click OK
4. Use the following code to replace the default code in the **ContactController** class:
    ```apex [ContactController.apxc]
    public with sharing class ContactController {
        @AuraEnabled
        public static List<contact> getContacts(string searchKey){
            string key = '%'+ searchKey +'%' ;
            return [SELECT Id,Name FROM Contact WHERE Name LIKE :key ORDER BY Name LIMIT 50];
      }
    }
    ```
5. Click on the **File** menu and select the **Save** option

### Retrieve the changes from the source org

We are going to retrieve the changes using the Metadata API. To do that, we need to inform the CLI about the changes we want to retrieve.

1. Modify the `package.xml` file in the **mdapi** folder and add the `ContactController` to the list of classes to retrieve.

    ```xml [package.xml] {9}
    <types>
      <members>GeocodingService</members>
      <members>GeocodingServiceTest</members>
      <members>PagedResult</members>
      <members>PropertyController</members>
      <members>SampleDataController</members>
      <members>TestPropertyController</members>
      <members>TestSampleDataController</members>
      <members>ContactController</members>
      <name>ApexClass</name>
    </types>
    ```
2. Run the following command to retrieve the changes from the source org:
    ```shell[Terminal]
    $ sfdx force:mdapi:retrieve -r temp -k mdapi/package.xml -u MdapiSource
    ```
3. After a few seconds, a zip file named `unpackaged.zip` should be created in the **temp** folder. This zip file contains the changes we have retrieved.
4. Uncompress the zip file and copy the content of the **unpackaged** folder to the **mdapi** folder, overwriting the existing files.
5. Run the following command to deploy the changes to the target org:
    ```shell[Terminal]
    $ sfdx force:mdapi:deploy -d mdapi -w 10 -u MdapiTarget
    ```
6. Open the target org in your browser and navigate to the **Property** object. You should see the **Amenities** field added to the layout.
    ```shell[Terminal]
    $ sfdx org open --target-org MdapiTarget
    ```
7. You can also verify that the `ContactController` class is also there by navigating to the **Apex Classes** page.

## Congratulations!

You have completed this section, you have:

- Forked a git repository
- Deployed the content of this repository to an org
- Added features to the app
- Retrieved the changes from the source org
- Deployed the changes to the target org

If you felt it was cumbersome, you are right, this is not the best way to work with Salesforce DX. In the next section, we will see how to use the Salesforce DX project and source tracking to make the process easier.

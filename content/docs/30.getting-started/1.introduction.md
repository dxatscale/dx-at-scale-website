The following challenges will enable you to learn Salesforce DX and understand how DX@Scale practices will help you in your modular development journey.

This section requires that you are comfortable with command-line interfaces, and the terminal and have a basic understanding of Salesforce.

It also requires that you have a Salesforce Org to work with. If you don't have one, you can create a free Developer Org on [https://developer.salesforce.com/signup](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) or use a Trailhead Playground.

title: When not to use DX@Scale
sub-title: DX@Scale is not a fit for all use cases. Please proceed with caution when you are applying these tools/techniques and any of the underlying scenarios are met
---

1. You or your team is not convinced of the benefits of modular development in Salesforce.
1. Your Release Model is predicated on infrequent deployments with large batches. As we are unable to install all packages currently in a single transaction, the time to deploy in production will be extremely high when you batch your changes across a large number of packages.  This is a limitation within Salesforce that will hopefully be addressed in future releases.
1. Your team is new to using version control and has no prior experience with CI/CD.
1. You are only looking for DevOps tools, not an overall approach to modular development.
1. No end-to-end ownership or visibility. You or your team's responsibility ends with development, but some other team or personnel is responsible for deployment.

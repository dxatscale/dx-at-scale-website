        <p>We have been early adopters of Salesforce DX and saw it as a massive step towards improving the developer/admin experience. The version control system was finally the source of truth, and we loved it.</p>
        <p>We wanted to take it to the next level and apply Continuous Delivery principles to Salesforce. We have defined an approach and a set of practices, and we have developed a set of tools to support them.</p>
        <p>We have open-sourced all of that. DX@Scale is now used on more than 150 Salesforce Production Orgs worldwide. We are grateful that some of these users allowed us to use their logos.</p>

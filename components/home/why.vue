          We had several sessions
          <a href="https://docs.dxatscale.io/talks-on-dx-scale">like this one</a>
          where we talked about our approach to building modular Salesforce Orgs: when we focus on sane Software Engineering principles like modularisation, trunk based development, continuous integration and the right tooling, we can build and maintain any org at any scale, with consistency, confidence and high level of quality.
